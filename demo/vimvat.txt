Vi(m)vat!


Of _vim_, ahem, I hum th' heroic hymn,
Extolling labours of the busy hive
That treat _menuitis_ vic√®d shipshape & trim,
Within the void of screen; let coding thrive--
Mnem0nic$ swarm, inviting no delay
To go berserk and rive a word, a file;
With colours vivid smiles the dark display,
Contriv'd events, commands, &c., become its style.
No pop-ups block the view with details gory,
Whereas the rival fingers skim the keys
That pave the _viam rectam_ t' hate and glory;
No mousy pivot (what a whim!) one sees:
Go to, apprentice!  sigh and cry _peccavi!_
Attesting to th' arcana i' hand _summa vi_.
